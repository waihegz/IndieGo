#IndieGo

This is an extremly simple 2D  imitation of pokemon game. It has the following features: 


* Vanilla gym battle 
* Pokemon and potion spawning 
* Ability to upgrade, rename, evolve and sell owned pokemons. 


This project was done as a component of my Software Engineering Practices course. The course's focus was the implementation of modern design architectures (such as MVC, MVVM) and design principles (such as SOLID).  Thus, the graphical quality of the game was not the focus and did not carry grade weight and as a consequence the graphics were done as simple as possible and most of my effort was dedicated to design and implement the data and logic classes. However, this codebase extensively leverage WPF data binding and the graphical interface can be completely altered with very minimal changes to the other layers. The pdf document describes the general design and the motivation behind it.
